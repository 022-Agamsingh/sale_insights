##📊 Sales Insights Dashboard using Power BI

This is a self-initiated data analytics project designed to demonstrate the ability to extract, analyze, and visualize business data using Power BI. The goal was to deliver a clear view of sales performance and help stakeholders make data-driven decisions.

🧠 Problem Statement
AtliQ Hardware is a company that supplies computer hardware and peripherals across various regions in India. The sales director has been struggling to understand business performance due to:

Declining sales over recent years
